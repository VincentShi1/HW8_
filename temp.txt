When i heard this song, i imagine myself drive a car alone in highway..
Oops  😊😊
so OMV is lesser views than 2011 views ??
Blonde Hillary Scott. I previously said somewhere else that footbal legend O.J. Simpson would be attracted to Scott since she would remind him of his late 2nd wife Nicole Brown Simpson(she was a pretty blonde also). Since Simpson will remain in jail for the rest of his life,there's no or very little chance of him linking with Scott. LOL
I love this song, and hope it to be a man and his woman getting together for good.
😊😊
I am so thankful that our last night together will remain timeless. Heading home soon; with any luck. 🙌💜❤️‍🩹🥹💙😘ICU2! 🥳🤷‍♀️🫣🙏💚😍
I just like the song. I would never go back. Those kind of dimes do not exist and the past belongs in the past. 😂😂😂

Eish, so much history in this song, and full ulbum as a whole
I remember this song because it was my friend, Patricia Trent's phone ringtone on her cellphone and her live- in helper would call her at work and she didn't like that. She would get upset when her mom's ex boyfriend, Paul Page ,would call her. She called him Paul the Pain and Paul the Pest.He looked like a anteater.
Hello there Adria nice meeting you here
Bravo!!! 👑 & QUEEN 👑
As beautiful as this song is I am confused. The two main singers sing about needing eachother, go to a party to see the other person, then both end up hooking up with 2 different people. I can't tell if the blond chick in the mask is the same girl or a different gal than the main singer Lady Antebellum.
❤❤❤ te amo\n😅😅😅😅
It would be 15 years together today. But she chose a different path... 😭😭😭
I love this song my husband Danny Epps and I danced to to this the other night!!

This brings back memories
❤
Still listening to this in 2023. It hits different day after day
I got through a breakup with this song and a bottle of Jack
Very addictive song -- Keeps spinning in your head------ and I love it.
IMO, the pop version sounds so much better than the country version, as far as the instrumentation and production, especially the guitar solo, which is a lot stronger and more emotional!
This song brings back so many memories :( i miss her so much
Great song:))))))
Love this song❤❤❤

Hello selamat malam adek ku apa kabar Terimah kassih adek selamat dagtang bergabug terus bersama herry yah adek  magtap adek ku oky jumpah lagi🙏🙏❤️❤️😭💐💐🙏🙏
English version:\n\nI remembered this beautiful song after ending my relationship with my old partner. The hard thing is not to lose someone. \n\nIt is rather the person asking for time and using that time to take advantage of us, abusing people's feelings.\n\nNow here I am! Listening to this beautiful song.\n\nVery complicated.\n\nPortuguês-Brasil versão:\n\nEu lembrei dessa música linda após terminar o meu relacionamento com a minha antiga parceira. \n\nO duro não é perder alguém. E sim a pessoa pedir tempo e usar esse tempo para tirar vantagens em cima da gente, abusando dos sentimentos das pessoas. \n\nAgora aqui estou! Escutando essa linda canção. \n\nMuito complicado.
🥺

Great Lord. Every time i hear this song i picture myself calling my ex and having the most romantic conversation on Earth. (her crying ..me crying) but when the song ends i never call her. I go play MW3 ..lame
Did you call her yet

 @ukmyname6213  hey i love u
I just need you now

Ditto
It's never things that you did that you regret....it's the things You DIDN'T do!!!!!
You know, my ex wasn't even there for me when I was with him... So I doubt he would ever be there for me now. So I will just keep hurting as I don't think I ever really felt anything else ... sad but true ...
Fight Fight Fight if it’s Right mate! \nLove ya bud ❤
I love this song

Beautiful song
this song really resonates my soul. i consider this as my ALL time favorite song. Back in 2014, i listen to this song repeatedly, like for hours until I wake up from a short nap, likfe for 2-3 hours. lol
I remember the boy but I don't remember the feeling anymore
I believe we all do ..well done lady antabellum
Picture, perfect memories\nScattered all around the floor\nReaching for the phone 'cause\nI can't fight it anymore\nAnd I wonder if I ever cross your mind\nFor me it happens all the time\n\nIt's a quarter after one\nI'm all alone and I need you now\nSaid I wouldn't call\nBut I lost all control and I need you now\nAnd I don't know how I can do without\nI just need you now\n\nAnother shot of whisky\nCan't stop looking at the door\nWishing you'd come sweeping\nIn the way you did before\nAnd I wonder if I ever cross your mind\nFor me, it happens all the time\n\nIt's a quarter after one\nI'm a little drunk\nAnd I need you now\nSaid I wouldn't call\nBut I lost all control and I need you now\nAnd I don't know how I can do without\nI just need you now\n\nGuess, I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all\nIt's a quarter after one\nI'm all alone and I need you now\nAnd I said I wouldn't call\nBut I'm a little drunk and I need you now\nAnd I don't know how I can do without\nI just need you now\nI just need you now\nOh, baby, I need you now
Its as sad as it was back then lord have mercy
Wish I would cross your mind missing our chats 😢
Or maybe you should call her.. just saying. There's the nope gopes and the sure hopes but then there's the miracles and God bless them 1 Kno i love them truly.. 11111111 11 xoxox
Will? Maybe. You aren't called your ex-wife if she's not married again that might be a calling from God? When. You listen to the? Song I'm not a genius. I'm just human-like everyone. Else? But maybe that song is. Your? Answer to being with her if you still have your chance.  If you do and you love her don't wait caller.\nYou may regret it if you don't. I hope you can get back with her. If not go on with Life. there's someone out there for you.
